- problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/

- একটা array এর যত ধরণের combination সম্ভব , সবগুলো চেক করতে হব।  যেসব কম্বিনেশন টার্গেট এর সাথে মিলবে ওগুলো প্রিন্ট করতে হবে |

## Problem input-output:

    Input:
        array = [2,3,6,7], 
        target = 7

    Output:
        [[2,2,3],[7]]

    Explaination:
        2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. 

        [Note that 2 can be used multiple times.]

        7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
        These are the only two combinations.

## Intuition:

- For questions like `printing combinations or subsequences`, the first thing that should strike in mind is recursion.

- #### How to think recursively?

    - Whenever the problem is related to `picking up elements from an array to form a combination`, start thinking about the `“Taking and non taking”` approach.

- #### Approach:
    - Recursive function definition:
    - <img src="999-com-sum.png">
    - Initially, the index will be 0, target as given and the data structure(vector or list) will be empty

    - Now there are 2 options viz to pick or not pick the current index element.

    - If you `pick` the element, `again come back at the same index` as `multiple occurrences` of the same element is possible. So the target reduces to `target – arr[index]` (where target -arr[index]>=0)and also insert the current element into the empty_vector. 

    - If you decide `not to pick` the current element, move on to the next index and the target value stays as it is. Also, the current element is not inserted into the data structure.

    - While backtracking makes sure to `pop the last element` as shown in the recursion tree below.

    - Keep on repeating this process while `index < size of the array` for a particular recursion call.

    - we can also stop the recursion when the target value is 0, but here a generalized version without adding too many conditions is considered.

    - Using this approach, we can get all the combinations.
- #### Base condition:

    - If index == size of array and  `target == 0` include the combination in our answer.

## Recursion Tree:

- The recursion tree will be too big..
The basic and main concepts are shown below.

        return;
    }

    // Taking the element

    if (target >= candidates[index])
    {


        empty_vec.push_back(candidates[index]);

        // taking এর সময় index  বাড়ানো যাবে না, কারণ কম্বিনেশন বের করতে বলা হয়েছ। 
        answer(index, candidates, target-candidates[index], ans, empty_vec);

        empty_vec.pop_back();
    }

    // Not taking the element
    

    answer(index + 1, candidates, target, ans, empty_vec);
}
vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int> &candidates, int target)
{
    vector<vector<int>> ans;
    vector<int> empty_vec;
    answer(0, candidates, target, ans, empty_vec);
    
    return ans;
}
int main()
{
    ll a;
    cin >> a;

    vi abc(a);
    fo(i, 0, a)
    {
        cin >> abc[i];
    }
    ll target;
    cin >> target;

    vector<vector<int>> cd = combinationSum(abc, target);
    cout<<cd.size()<<endl;
    for (auto &i : cd)
    {
        for (auto &j : i)
        {
            cout << j << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
## Time comnplexity:

-  `O(2^t * k)` where t is the target, k is the average length of `empty_vector`

- Assume if you were not allowed to pick a single element multiple times, every element will have a couple of options: pick or not pick which is 2^n different recursion calls, also assuming that the average length of every combination generated is k. (to put length k data structure into another data structure)

- Why not (2^n) but (2^t) (where n is the size of an array)?

- Assume that there is 1 and the target you want to reach is 10 so 10 times you can “taking and not taking” an element.

## Space Complexity:

- ` O(k*x)` k is the average length and x is the no. of combinations
