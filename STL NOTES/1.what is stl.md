# STL (Standard Template Library )

- STL stands for Standard Template Library. STL is a set of general-purpose classes and functions which are mainly used for storing and processing data. STL can be defined as a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. 
- The main idea behind STL is to reuse codes already written and tested.
- It saves time and effort.  


- STL has four components
    - **Algorithms:** It defines a collection of functions specially designed to be used on ranges of elements. Examples are sorting, searching, etc.
    - **Containers:** Containers store objects and data. There are in total seven standard “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these  container adaptors.
    - **Functions:** STL includes classes which overload the function call operator. Instances of such classes are called functors.
    - **Iterators:** It is used for working upon a sequence of values.It provides generiality in STL.
