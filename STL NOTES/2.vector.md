# Vector

## `Various Functions in Vectors are`  
- **Iterators:**

    - begin() –  It returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the vector.

    - end() – It returns an iterator pointing to the last element in the vector.
    - rbegin() – It returns a reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the vector.
    - rend() – It returns a reverse iterator pointing to the element preceding the first element in the vector. Basically considered as a reverse end.
    - cbegin() – It returns a constant iterator pointing to the first element in the vector.
    - cend() – It returns a constant iterator pointing to the element that follows the last element in the vector.
    - crbegin() – It returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the last element in the vector.
    - crend() – It returns a constant reverse iterator pointing to the element preceding the first element in the vector.

```C++
//C++ Code to Visualize Use of Iterators in C++
#include <iostream> 
#include <vector> 
using namespace std;   
int main() 
{ 
    vector<int> a; //Declaration of vector in C++
   
   //It is better to allocat vector like this:
    //a.reserve(8);

   //Initializing vector ‘a’ with values from 1 to 7
    for (int i = 1; i <=7 ; i++) 
        a.push_back(i); 

    //Printing the Output of vector ‘a’ using iterators  begin() and end()  
    cout << "Output of begin and end Function: "; 
    for (auto i = a.begin(); i != a.end(); ++i) 
        cout << *i << " "; 
   
   //Printing the Output of vector ‘a’ using iterators cbegin() and cend()
    cout << "\nOutput of cbegin and cend Function: "; 
    for (auto i = a.cbegin(); i != a.cend(); ++i) 
        cout << *i << " "; 
   
   //Printing the output of vector ‘a’ using iterators rbegin() and rend()
    cout << "\nOutput of rbegin and rend Function: "; 
    for (auto ir = a.rbegin(); ir != a.rend(); ++ir) 
        cout << *ir << " "; 
  
    //Printing the output of vector ‘a’ using iterators crbegin() and crend()
    cout << "\nOutput of crbegin and crend Function: "; 
    for (auto ir = a.crbegin(); ir != a.crend(); ++ir) 
        cout << *ir << " "; 
  
    return 0; 
}

- **Capacity:**

    - size() – It returns the number of elements currently present in the vector.

    - max_size() – It returns the maximum number of elements that a vector can hold.
    - capacity() – It returns the storage capacity currently allocated to the vector.
    - resize(n) – It resizes the container to store ‘n’ elements.
    - empty() – It returns whether the container is empty or not.

```C++
//C++ program to demonstrate working of capacity function
#include <iostream>
#include <vector> 
using namespace std; 
int main() 
{ 
   //Declaring vector ‘a’ of integer type 
   vector<int> a; 
   
   //Initializing vector ‘a’ with values from 1 to 5
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) 
        a.push_back(i); 
  
    //Printing size of the vector ‘a’
    cout << "Size : " << a.size(); 
   
    //Printing the Capacity of the vector ‘a’
    cout << "\nCapacity : " << a.capacity(); 
    
    //Printing the maximum size of the vector ‘a’
    cout << "\nMax_Size : " << a.max_size(); 
  
    // resizing  the vector ‘a’ to  size  4 
    a.resize(4); 
  
    // printing the vector ‘a’ size after resize() function
    cout << "\nSize : " << a.size(); 
  
    // checks if the vector is empty or not 
    if (a.empty() == false) 
        cout << "\nVector is not empty"; 
    else
        cout << "\nVector is empty"; 
  
  
    return 0; 
}

- **Modifiers:**

    - assign() – It assigns a new value to the existing elements of the vector.

    - push_back() – It pushes the element from back in the vector.
    - pop_back() – It removes elements from the back of the vector.
    - insert() – It inserts an element before a specified element in the vector.
    - erase() – It is used to remove elements from a specified element or a range in the vector.
    - swap() – It is used to swap the contents of two vectors of the same datatype. The sizes of vectors may differ.
    - clear() – It is used to remove all the elements from the vector.

```C++
    // Declaring Vector ‘a’ of integer type
    vector<int> a; 
  
    // filling vector ‘a’ with 7 in repetition of 4 times
    a.assign(4, 7); 

    // inserting 3 at the beginning of vector ‘a’
    a.insert(a.begin(), 3); 

    // removing the first element 
     a.erase(a.begin()); 

     // erasing the vector 
    a.clear(); 


```

- **Element access:**

    - reference_operator[g]: It returns a reference to the ‘g’ element in the vetor.

    - at(g): It returns a reference to the element at position ‘g’ in the vector.
    
    - front(): It returns a reference to the first element in the vector.
    - back(): It returns a reference to the last element in the vector.
    - data(): It returns a direct pointer to the memory array which is used internally by the vector to store its owned elements.

```C++

   //Using reference operator to print vector ‘a’ third element
    cout << "\nReference operator [g] : a[2] = " << a[2]; 
   
   //printing element at index 4 of the vector ‘a’
    cout << "\nat : a.at(4) = " << a.at(4); 
   
   //printing the front element of vector ‘a’
    cout << "\nfront() : a.front() = " << a.front(); 
  
   //printing the back element of vector ‘a’
    cout << "\nback() : a.back() = " << a.back(); 
  
    // pointer to the first element 
    int* pos = a.data();
