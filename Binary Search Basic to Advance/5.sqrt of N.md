# Square Root using binary search.

- You are given a number N.  
- **Find out** 
    - Square root of N.
    - If N is not the **perfect square** than return floor value of square root of N.
    - **NOTE : Time complexity should be O log(n)**  
- **Techniques**:  
    - Apply binary search between 1 to N.
    - As our goal is to find **the largest value** which **square is the smaller than or equal to N**
            
            Lets N=30.
            Largest i * i <= N
            So, i=5
## C++ Code:
---
- As our purpose is **largest i * i <= N**, thats why -
    - If **mid*mid <= target** 
        - mid will be a possible answer. so, **ans=mid** and **high=mid-1**
        - else **low=mid+1**
```C++  
#include <iostream>
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define fast()ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0);cin.tie(0);cout.tie(0);
#define ll long long int
using vi = vector <int>;
using vll = vector <ll>;
#define pb push_back;
#define fo(i,a,b) for(ll i=(a);i<(b);i++)
#define w(x)            ll x; cin>>x; while(x--)
#define b() begin()
#define e() end()
#define cY cout<<"YES\n"
#define cN cout<<"NO\n"
#define cy cout<<"Yes\n"
#define cn cout<<"No\n"

ll square_root(ll a){
    ll low=1;
    ll high=a;
    ll ans = 1;
    while( low <= high ){
        ll mid = low + ( high - low )/2;
        
        if( mid*mid <= a) ans = mid,low = mid+1;
        else high = mid-1;
    }
    return ans;
}
int main()
{    
    ll N;
    cin>>N;
    cout<<square_root(N)<<endl;
}
