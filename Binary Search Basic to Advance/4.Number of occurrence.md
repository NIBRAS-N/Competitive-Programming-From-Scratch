# Number of occurrence of target.

- You are given an array consists of multiple sorted numbers.   
**Like: 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 4 5**.  
- **Find out** 
    - ***Number of occurrence*** of target.  
    
    - **NOTE : Time complexity should be O log(n)**  
            
          If target=4, Number of occurrence = 3.

- **Techniques**:  
As we have to solve this problem **in O(log(n))** we can't *travarse the whole array and count the target*. It will give **O(n)**.So, We can solve it using binary  property.
    - **Type 1 :**
        - **( Last occurrence - First occurrence )+1.**

              arr[]={1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5}
              Target = 4
              Last Occurrence = 7
              first Occurrence = 5
              So, answer will be (7-5)+1=3
        - But if the ***target is not in the array*** answer will be (-1-1)+1. It will be wrong answer.
    - **Type 2:**
        - **Upper bound - Lower bound**  
        
              arr[]={1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5}
              Target = 4
              Upper Bound = 8
              Lower Bound = 5
              So, answer will be (8-5)=3

## C++ code:
--- 
```C++
int main()
{
    ll a;
    cin>>a;
    ll abc[a];
    for(int i=0;i<a;i++){
        cin>>abc[i];
    }
    cout << "Number of occurrence = "<< (upper_bound(abc,abc+a,target)-abc) -  (lower_bound(abc,abc+a,target)-abc)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
```
