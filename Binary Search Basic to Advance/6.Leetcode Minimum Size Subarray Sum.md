## **``MONOTONIC``** Property will be learned through this problem.
---
## What is **monotonic property**?
    - In this system we will run binary search on probable answer, Not on the array.

    - When there exist couples of parameters, And on this parameters everything increased or decreased then this situation is called monotonic.

    - Mainly it is binary search on the answer

## Problem Statement:
---
- An array and target will be given.
- We have to return the minimal length of the contigious subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.
- target = 7, nums = {2,3,1,2,4,3}
- Minimum length will be 2 [4,3] which  ***sum  >= target 7***
## Approach:
---
- The minimum answer (length) would be **one**, and maximum length would be **size of the array**.
- If length increased then sum will also be increased, If length decreased sum will also be decreased. So, Theres exist a monotonic property.
- For previous test case the answer would lie between 1 and 7.
- So we will run binary search on 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ***[Length of the array]***
- **Low=1 , High = 7, mid = 4**
    - From array {2,3,1,2,4,3} we will find every 4 length subarrays sum and find the maximum .
    - 2+3+1+2=8 , 3+1+2+4=10 , 1+2+4+3=10 . [Max =10 && 10>=7] 
    - There exist an answer, so we will elimante the right side portion **[High = mid]**
- **Low = 1 , High = 4 , mid = 3**
    - Max subarray sum of 3 length = 9, 9>=7 so It will also be an answer.
    - High = mid
- **Low = 1, High = 3 , mid = 2**
    - Max subarray sum of 2 length = 7, 7>=7 so It will also be an answer.
    - High = mid
- **Low = 1, High = 2, mid= 1**
    -- Max subarray sum of 1 length = 4, 4 <= 7 so It will not be an answer.
    - Low = mid+1
- **LOW = 2 , High = 2 , While loop ends . and our answer is 2.**
