# Description and Intuition:

- The problem requires finding the length of the longest substring containing the same letter after at most k changes to any character in the string. To achieve this, we can use a sliding window approach to efficiently process the string and keep track of the frequency of characters within the window.

# Approach:

-  Initialize a sliding window with two pointers, left and right. Also, maintain an hash_map to store the frequency of characters in the current window.

-  As the window slides to the right, update the frequency count of the characters encountered in the alphabets map. Additionally, keep track of the maximum frequency (maxf) of any character in the current window.

-  Check if the length of the current window minus the maximum frequency exceeds k. This condition ensures that we have at most k changes to any character in the window.

-   If the condition from step 3 is met, move the left pointer and update the frequency count accordingly until the condition is satisfied. This step ensures that the window remains valid.

-   During each iteration, update the answer (ans) with the maximum length of the window seen so far.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
        vector<int>count(26);
        int i=0;
        int j=0;
        int result =0;
        int mxCount =0;
        while(j<s.size()){
            count[s[j]-'A']++;
            // cout<<count[s[j]-'A']<<endl;
            mxCount = max(mxCount , count[s[j]-'A']);
            if(j-i+1-mxCount > k  && i<=j){
                count[s[i]-'A']--;
                i++;
            }
            result = max(result,j-i+1);
            j++;
            // cout<<i<<" "<<j<<" "<<mxCount<<endl;
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
