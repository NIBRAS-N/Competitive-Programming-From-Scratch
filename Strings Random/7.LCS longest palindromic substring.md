# LC5: Longest Palindromic Substring
---

- Given a string s, return the longest 
palindromic.
    
## Intuition:

Now, we can solve this question in two ways that come at first glance:

- **Use Brute Force :**  
Check for every corresponding element in string the longest palindrome possible and do it till the end.

- **DP:**  
somehow use the result from our previous iteration to simplify the current one.


## Analysis:
1. **Brute Force:** Instead of directly going to code and finding a problem later, lets stop and think about the concept we intend to use here .  
_**Concept:**_   
We will go through all possible element in string and find the longest palindrome amongst them.  

    **Review:**   
To calculate all the possible substrings in a string of length n ,number of combinations generated are:
1+2+3+4+..........n=n(n-1)/2.
==> To check all the substrings for Palindrome, we will have to go through all the n characters
==> Total Combinations: n*n(n-1)/2= O(n^3)

    **Conclusion:**  
     Since the time complexity is O(n^3), hence we will not discuss on this approach, and our energy would be better spent looking at DP solution .

2. **DP:**   
Instead of going through all the previous Palindromes again and again, we will save them somewhere and calculate the new ones based on them,  Lets see it below

    **Concept:**   
    To check a Palindrome of length ,say l, we just have to check 

        i. if s[first character]==s[last character]
        ii. s[first character+1, last charcter -1] is a Palindrome or not.

    **For example :** 

        say s=" balab"
        Now, to check , if "s" is Palindrome or not, we just have to look at
        i. s[first character]==s[last character] -> b==b -> True

        ii. s[first character+1, last charcter -1] is a Palindrome
         --> "ala" is a Palindrome??

        To check for "ala", a==a--> True , and "l" is a Palindrome(of length 1)

        ==> s is a Plaindrome

    **Review**:  
        To do this we will make a table like this:
